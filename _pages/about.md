<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an Associate Professor at Shandong University in Jinan, China. From 2022 to 2025, I was a Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore, working in the Human Language Technology (HLT) Lab with Prof. Haizhou Li. I received my PhD and Bachelor’s degrees from Zhejiang University (ZJU), Hangzhou, China, in 2021 and 2016, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Gang Pan and Prof. Huajin Tang.

My research interests include spiking neural networks: encoding, learning and architecture design; event-based vision: object/motion/emotion recognition, tracking; (audio-only or audio-visual) speech processing: recognition, keyword spotting and voice activity detection.
